### Collection created at the beginning of my Java learning journey :books:
They help me gain familiarity with the language`s core concepts and syntax and served as an introduction to the use of Eclipse.

***I strongly disencourage you to copy these projects and pass them as your own assignments.*** :roll_eyes:

On the other hand I would not mind at all if you use my solutions as inspiration to make you own improvements 
or to develop your own project ideas. :wink:

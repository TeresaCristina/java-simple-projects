### Collection created at the beginning of my Java learning journey :books:
They help me gain familiarity with the language`s core concepts and syntax and served as an introduction to the use of Eclipse.

***I strongly disencourage you to copy these projects and pass them as your own assignments.*** :roll_eyes:

On the other hand I would not mind at all if you use my solutions as inspiration to make you own improvements 
or to develop your own project ideas. :wink:

### 1. ComplexNumbers 
Basic Math Operations using [Complex Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

- MathOperations : Interface
- Complex Numbers : algorithm for sum, subtraction, multiplication, division
- GetInput : generates a string with the user input
- Utilities : static method that tranforms a String array into a Double array

**Keywords:** _Scanner Class , Basic Mathematical Operations , Block Try/Catch , One-Dimensional Array , Loops , Abstract Class , Overloading_ 

### 2. CreditCardNumber :credit_card:
It checks if a number is a valid credit card number using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). Assumes input is always an integer.

- AllocateNumber (collects user input)
- CreditCard (uses the Luhn algorithm)

**Keywords:** _Scanner Class , Basic Mathematical Operations , Long Int , One-Dimensional Array , Loops_ 

### 3. GetLoan :moneybag:
Calculates [loan payments](https://www.thebalance.com/loan-payment-calculations-315564). The user inputs Amount, Timespan and a Interest Rate.

- GetLoan (validates user input and gives the output)
- GetInput (methods to checks if user input is a number)
- SpecialNumber (calculates monthly payment)

**Keywords:**_Scanner Class , Basic Mathematical Operations , Loops_ 

### 4.HangMan :raising_hand_man:
Play [Hang-Man](https://hangmanwordgame.com/) with the computer. Simple version that uses an array with five words.

- HangMan (plays the game)
- Output (method that transforms a char Array in a String)
- GetInput (checks if the user inpput is one letter)

_Scanner Class , One-Dimensional Array , Random Class , Pattern , Regex , Loops_  

### 5.MatrixBigNumber :hash:
Creates a [matrix](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-algebra/chapter/introduction-to-matrices/) using user input for dimensions and to fill it with integers. Finds the location of the higher number.

- BigNumber (fills the matrix with user input and gives output with results)
- BuildMatrix (creates a matrix and finds its higher number)
- GetOutput (outputs one row from the matrix)
- GetInput (checks if the user input is an integer)

_Scanner Class , One-Dimensional Array , Two-Dimensional Array , Block Try/Catch , Loops_ 

### 6.RandomArray
Generates a random [One-Dimensional Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) of integers. 

- RandomIntArray: generates an array filled with integers
- RandomInteger : generates a random integer 
- GetInput: generates a string with user input
- Utilities: static method that tranforms stringo to integer

_Scanner Class , Random Class , One-Dimensional Array , Block try/Catch, Loops_ 

### 7.RockPaperScissor :scissors:
Play [Rock-Paper-Scissor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) with the computer.

- RockPaperScissor (plays the game)
- Getinput (checks if user input is an integer)

_Scanner Class , Random Class , One-Dimensional Array , Loops_ 

### 8.WeekDay :calendar:
Finds out the weekday of an specific calendar day using the [Zeller algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence).

- WeekDay (validates user input for a valida calendary day)
- SpecialNumber (Zeller algorithm)
- GetInput (checks if user input is a valid integer)

_Scanner Class , One-Dimensional Array , Basic Mathematical Operations , Loops_
